This is an audio visualizer video maker / creator that uses HTML5 only. It has a sidebar which has options for picking the background image, visualizer type, color, etc. In the main area the visualizer is a canvas element. The animation is drawn using requestAnimationFrame to update the canvas. The canvas is recorded using captureStream and MediaRecorder. There are some limitations and caveats due to it being HTML5. I've included them along with other documentation inside the web page itself. Just click the open documentation button on the very top of the sidebar which gives details on options, limitations, credits, etc. You can also view the same info on the wiki: https://github.com/isaiah658/isaiah658.github.io/wiki

Here is the website link to use the video maker: https://isaiah658.github.io or you can download this project/repository and open the index.html file.

Here is a video demonstration of some visualizations I made to try and showcase what is possible: https://youtu.be/CDO8nstm4I0
