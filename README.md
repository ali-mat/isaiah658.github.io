This is an audio visualizer video maker / creator that uses HTML5 only. It has a sidebar which has options for picking the background image, visualizer type, color, etc. In the main area the visualizer is a canvas element. The animation is drawn using requestAnimationFrame to update the canvas. The canvas is recorded using captureStream and MediaRecorder. There are some limitations and caveats due to it being HTML5. I've included them along with other documentation inside the web page itself. Just click the open documentation button on the very top of the sidebar which gives details on options, limitations, credits, etc. I'll add the documentation here at some point as well for people who might not be able to open documentation in the web page for what ever reason.
